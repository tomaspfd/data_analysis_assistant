Decide on imputation or removal based on the extent of missingness.
Candidate Primary Key,source_url,All 478 values are unique.,"None, this column is suitable as a unique identifier."
Candidate Composite Primary Key,"brand, model",All 478 combinations are unique.,"None, this combination is suitable as a unique identifier."
Data Type/Format Mismatch,cargo_volume_l,Non-numeric values like '10 Banana Boxes' found.,"Extract numerical values, handle non-numeric entries, and convert to a numeric type. Then impute missing values."
Data Type Inconsistency (NaN as float),model,NaN values are represented as float.,Convert column to string type after handling NaNs if pure string type is desired.
Data Type Inconsistency (NaN as float),fast_charge_port,NaN values are represented as float.,Convert column to string type after handling NaNs if pure string type is desired.
